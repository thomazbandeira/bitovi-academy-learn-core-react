# Academy of bitovi - Core React (Review)

I was interested in taking this class to return to being full stack. My strong point is currently Backend or solution architecture.


## What is React?

React is a front-end JavaScript library designed for building scalable and dynamic web applications. It’s renowned for its ability to break down the view layer of applications into small, reusable components, which are rendered as plain HTML. These components make up the core of React’s architecture, allowing for efficient and manageable development.

React is versatile and isn’t limited to web apps. It can also be used for creating mobile and desktop apps through platforms like React Native for mobile development and Electron for desktop applications. While this course focuses on web development, the concepts apply across these different environments.
